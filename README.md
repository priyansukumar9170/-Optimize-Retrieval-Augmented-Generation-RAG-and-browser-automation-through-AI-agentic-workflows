# -Optimize-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-and-browser-automation-through-AI-agentic-workflows

**Objective:** Enhance RAG performance and automate browser workflows using agentic AI systems

* Conducted an in-depth literature review of 15+ GenAI research papers to inform system design with state-of-the-art approaches

* Engineered an agentic RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex for document ingestion, summarization, and intelligent question answering

* Productized the solution into a modular, user-ready tool supporting seamless document-query interactions

* Automated browser tasks via function calling, integrating a multi-modal LLM to interpret and execute natural language instructions with high precision
